# 🎯 Drag Engine

> **A precision-crafted, cross-platform drag and drop engine for Flutter applications**

Engineered with Test-Driven Development for bulletproof reliability and optimized for mobile-first experiences.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Drag Engine** is the foundational component for a 1010 game clone, built with an unwavering focus on perfecting drag and drop functionality before any other feature development. This library represents a methodical, step-by-step approach to creating smooth, responsive, and reliable drag interactions across all platforms.

### 🎯 Mission Statement
*Perfect the drag and drop experience first, build everything else second.*

This project prioritizes the core interaction mechanics that will make or break the user experience in touch-based puzzle games.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.10.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.0.0)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
cd drag-engine

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run tests to verify setup
flutter test

# Check code quality
dart analyze
```

### Basic Usage
```dart
import 'package:drag_engine/drag_engine.dart';

final controller = DragController();

// Start drag operation
controller.startDrag(Offset(100, 200));

// Update position during drag
controller.updateDragPosition(Offset(150, 250));

// End drag operation
controller.endDrag();
```

## 🧪 Development Philosophy

This project follows a **strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach:

1. **Red** - Write failing tests first
2. **Green** - Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while maintaining test coverage

### Test Coverage
- **Current Coverage**: 100% (7/7 tests passing)
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests for workflows
- **Quality Gates**: All tests must pass before any feature merge

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Enhanced Gesture Detection** - Multi-finger and complex gesture support
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - 60fps guarantee across all target devices
3. **Event System** - Robust drag event handling and callbacks
4. **Drop Target System** - Intelligent drop zone detection and validation

### Long-term Vision
- Complete 1010 game implementation using this engine
- Open-source library for Flutter drag and drop interactions
- Performance benchmarks and optimization case studies
